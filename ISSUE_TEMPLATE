<!-- 
Participants will be instructed to create or join a breakout group. Breakout groups can take any form: it can be a working group for projects, or discussion groups for discussions.

There are two types of break-out groups:

1. Discussion Groups: Groups centered on learning new things, discussing issues, building networks, and strategizing. This can also be a place where organizations can figure their technical needs and how they're going to solve their problems. Be sure to be clear on what you want to accomplish!

2. Working Groups: do you have a project? Working groups are breakouts focused on either onboarding, training, or just having a team setup on collectively coding for your awesome project! Be sure to be clear on what you want to accomplish!
