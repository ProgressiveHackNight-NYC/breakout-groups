# Progressive Hack Night

## Progressive Hack Night NYC - Breakout Groups

At the Progressive Hack Night, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for applications. The groups are split into two types: working groups and discussion groups.

These groups change from week to week, with some lasting just a single night to others progressing over several years. To keep track of these fluctuating groups, we use GitHub issues to open, close and update groups over time.

<!-- Currently Building it: You can see the full list of projects on the [Chi Hack Night Breakout Groups page](https://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html), or in the [issues list for this GitHub repository](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues). -->

## How do I add a group to the list?

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
2. Open a new GitHub Issue in this repository: https://github.com/ProgressiveHackNight-NYC/breakout-groups/issues/new
3. Set the title of your issue to the name of your breakout, and fill out the description template in the body. We will add the appropriate labels to it.
